				What do I do?
			</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a Math and Computer Science Major at McGill University. <br><br> Have you heard of TF2? Yeah well I wrote a BOT in python that scours three websites
				looking for a low seller and a high buyer for what are called "unusual hats". Once my BOT found those two people, it acted as the middle man. 
				Granted it made an average of five cents per transaction, but leaving it run overnight, and having ittrade in the Russian and Chinese market made 
				for some nice passive income. And I would have made even more money but then I got banned for toO mAnY reQuEsts. Well sorry your servers are utter
				garbage. <br><br> This served not only as programming experience, but as a life lesson as well. I learned that no matter where you go, there will
				always be haters tryna keep a playa down.
