				What do I do?
			</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a Math and Computer Science Major at McGill University. <br><br> Have you heard of TF2? Yeah well I wrote a BOT in python that scours three websites
				looking for a low seller and a high buyer for what are called "unusual hats". Once my BOT found those two people, it acted as the middle man. 
				Granted it made an average of five cents per transaction, but leaving it run overnight, and having it trade in the Russian and Chinese market made 
				for some nice passive income. And I would have made even more money but then I got banned for too many requests. Sad.

			<h2>
				What do you need?
			</h2>
			<p>
				I will make you a website, a Unity game, a python script, Java or C$ program and more. I have good experience in Web Crawling. If you'd like a
				cheap website, I can make you one similar to this one and help you host it.
				<br><br>
				My code is clean and it will be easy for you to bring it to another programmer for future modifications if I'm not around. Please email me with your
				requests and we can arrange a deal. oussama.khalifeh@mail.mcgill.ca
